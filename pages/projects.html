						<h3>Scott A. Young Website</h3>
						<p>For this project, I worked with a client to create a full-stack web application to
						advertise his new book. I worked with React on the front-end, and used PHP for the back-end code.</p>

						<h3>Portfolio Site</h3>
						<p>For this project, I created a portfolio website in NextJS. There is a lot of functionality inculding a contact form,
						several links to my social media pages, and a download for my resume. I'm especially happy with the gradient borders I was able to create.</p>

						<h3>Chess Project</h3>
						<p>This is another project I developed using NextJS. The goal of this project was to create a chess game that could be played 
						against a chess engine in the browser. After I had got the chess game itself worked out, I lost intrest in the rest of the 
						functionality I had originally wanted, but I still think it's in a pretty good state.</p>

						<h3>BlackJack</h3>
						<p>This is a project I did during undergrad for my Programming Languages course. The final project was to create a project in 
						a language that I didn't know, so I chose Rust because I had heard a lot of great things about the language and it intrigued me.
						The project has two main pieces. The first is a backend that handles all the game logic, and the second is a front-end
						to handle displaying the information in the browser. At the time I had very little experience with CSS and if I went back to this
						I would style it better.</p>

						<h3>8 Queens AI Project</h3>
						<p>This is a project that I completed for my Artificial Intelligence class in undergrad. The Assignment was to create multiple different
						AI algorithms in Python to solve the 8 Queens Problem. The 8 Queens problem involves finding a position for 8 Queens on a chess board where they 
						do not attack each other. The image shows the initial prompt and a small portion of a solution done by one of the algorithms.</p>
